# Activelearning
Active learning is the process of interactively quering the user to train an algorithm. The quering can be done in an efficient manner, so that the least amount of queries is needed.

This repository contains research code and is not maintained. The code is over two years old and does not reflect my current software design skills. 

The code has Spark applications as well as many algorithm implementations.
